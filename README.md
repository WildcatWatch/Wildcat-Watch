# 🐾 WildcatWatch

Wildcat Watch is a web-based platform designed to monitor and track the attendance 
and duties of campus security guards and janitors in real-time. This system ensures that 
all assigned shifts are logged accurately, enabling administrators to verify attendance, 
track task completion, and improve operational efficiency. Currently, manual attendance 
and duty logs result in inaccuracies, reporting delays, and problems monitoring 
employee compliance.
